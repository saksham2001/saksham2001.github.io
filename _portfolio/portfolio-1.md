## Project Mission:
Simulate the colonization of Mars by designing as well as building a radio-controlled primary aircraft capable of releasing secondary autonomously guided colonist delivery aircraft (CDA) and supply payloads for the survival of the colonists.

The CDA needs to be an autonomous glider under 255 grams without any propulsion system. The supply payloads are Nerf howlers and Water bottles. The Final Flight Score is directly proportional to the days of habitability of the colonists.

## My Role:
* Member of the Avionics and Propulsion Department of Team Assailing Falcons.
* Designed the Data Acquisition System (DAS) including the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the hardware implementation. DAS is used to receive live telemetry data from various sensors on-board and features control panel to drop the payloads.
* Developed the algorithms for Autonomous Navigation and Stabilisation of Colonist Delivery Aircraft.

* Developed Autonomous Payload Drop System which automaticcally triggers the drop of staic payload based on data from various sensors.
* Compared  more than 100 Power Plant configurations to select the appropriate one for the Primary Aircraft.
* Responsible for drafting the Technical Design Report containing every aspect of making the aircraft in detail.
* Designed the team website for the year 2021: [link](https://assailingfalcons.in/) \| [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210813221449/https://assailingfalcons.in/)
