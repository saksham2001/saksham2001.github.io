This project was undertaken during Winter Intership 2019 at Avionics Lab, Space Technology and Rocketry (STAR) Lab, Surat, India

## Project Mission:
To Design and Develop a High Powered Model Rocket. This Rocket shall reach a minimum height of 120 meters Propulsively and shall have a Recovery System to Land on Ground safely.



## My Role:
* Member of the Avionics and Propulsion Department of Team Assailing Falcons.
* Designed the Data Acquisition System (DAS) including the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the hardware implementation. DAS is used to receive live telemetry data from various sensors on-board and features control panel to drop the payloads.
* Developed the algorithms for Autonomous Navigation and Stabilisation of Colonist Delivery Aircraft.
