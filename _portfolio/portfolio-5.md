## Project Mission:
Simulate the colonization of Mars by designing as well as building a radio-controlled primary aircraft capable of releasing secondary autonomously guided colonist delivery aircraft (CDA) and supply payloads for the survival of the colonists.

The CDA needs to be an autonomous glider under 255 grams without any propulsion system. The supply payloads are Nerf howlers and Water bottles. The Final Flight Score is directly proportional to the days of habitability of the colonists.

## My Role:
* Member of the Avionics and Propulsion Department of Team Assailing Falcons.
* Designed the Data Acquisition System (DAS) including the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Ground Station. to receive live telemetry data from various sensors on-board and control panel to drop the payloads.
* CDA Algorithm
* Key Sponsorship
* Autonomous Payload Drop
* Designed website  
* Responsible for drafting the Technical Design Report containing every aspect of making the aircraft in detail.

## Project Accomplishments:
* **1st Worldwide in Design Report** - SAE International Aerodesign Competition (Lakeland, Florida, USA)
* **1st Rank Overall in Asia** - SAE International Aerodesign Competition (Lakeland, Florida, USA)
* **5th Rank Overall Worldwide** - SAE International Aerodesign Competition (Lakeland, Florida, USA)
