  abstract={Our healthcare systems face increasing demands due to staff shortages, overcrowded emergency rooms, and new challenges from infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This study reviews research on health kiosks, a type of self-service technology designed to help address these challenges. Health kiosks can measure vital signs, assist in diagnosing conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and offer remote care to ease the strain on healthcare workers. We reviewed studies on kiosks developed between 2013 and 2023, finding that they show potential for improving access and efficiency in healthcare. However, the widespread use of health kiosks is limited by technical, financial, and regulatory challenges. Addressing these issues could enable health kiosks to become a more common tool in healthcare, helping people access care more easily and improving health outcomes.}

  abstract={This paper proposes a deep-learning-based novel decision-making network named LaneScanNET to assist the ADS in lane-changing or lane-keeping decision-making. The proposed system assists ADS in detecting obstacles, localization of the Ego Vehicle (EGV) on roads, and estimating lane status in its Field of View (FOV). The proposed LaneScanNET uses a parallel pipeline with an Obstacle Detection Network (ODN) and a Lane Detection Network (LDN) to simultaneously process the incoming image frames for detecting obstacles and segmenting lane lines, respectively. Further, the Obstacle-Lane Fusion Network (OLFN) fuses these results to predict the status of the obstacle lane in the FOV of autonomous vehicles. Vellore Institute of Technology’s (VIT’s) real-time driving dataset on indigenous roads has been collected to train the proposed LaneScanNET with 2464 obstacle-lane images obtained by driving over 60 km. The dataset generated for obstacle detection and its corresponding lane detection has also been made publicly available to promote research work for these developing countries. The proposed system outperforms all existing networks on Indian roads with an accuracy of 75.28% in obstacle detection and 91.36% in lane detection. Additionally, the proposed system can analyze the lane status with an accuracy of 92.54%. The proposed network performs exceptionally well in unforeseen circumstances like shadows, fog, dust, and occlusions making LaneScanNET a robust network that can be an add-on for ADS to make lane-keeping or lane-changing decisions. The LaneScanNET can be integrated into real-time vehicles to assist drivers or ADS.}

  abstract={Agriculture is back bone of world’s economy and human life to survive. Agricultural Industry  has more or  less  remained  dependent  on conventional  methods  of  farming.  The  farming  conditions  have  changed  significantly  over  last  few  decades.  Soil  Fertility,  Amount  of Water for Irrigation and other resources have become scarcer but the global population has increased immensely. This calls in need for implementation  of  better  farming  methods  like  precision  farming  which  increase  the  overall  yield.  In  recent  years  there  had  a gradual increase  in  the  usage  of  such  systems.  WSNs  tell  us  about  some  problems  like  interoperability,  communications,  scalability and connectivity. The main aim for precision farming (PA) is to increase the farming production by concerning climate, water quality, terrain, weather  and  crop  status.    In  recent  years  farmers  are  using  information  systems  for  the  improvement  of  crop  management  and  to increase productivity. This leads to create a platform for managing farm activities and to improve biodiversity and to reduce the usage of water. Such new invention should be made to enhance and develop the farming. This paper analyses and reveals how IoT can lay a strong foundation towards sustainable development in agriculture.  }
