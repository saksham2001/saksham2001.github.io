griculture is back bone of worldâ€™s economy and human life to survive. Agricultural Industry  has more or  less  remained  dependent  on conventional  methods  of  farming.  The  farming  conditions  have  changed  significantly  over  last  few  decades.  Soil  Fertility,  Amount  of Water for Irrigation and other resources have become scarcer but the global population has increased immensely. This calls in need for implementation  of  better  farming  methods  like  precision  farming  which  increase  the  overall  yield.  In  recent  years  there  had  a gradual increase  in  the  usage  of  such  systems.  WSNs  tell  us  about  some  problems  like  interoperability,  communications,  scalability and connectivity. The main aim for precision farming (PA) is to increase the farming production by concerning climate, water quality, terrain, weather  and  crop  status.    In  recent  years  farmers  are  using  information  systems  for  the  improvement  of  crop  management  and  to increase productivity. This leads to create a platform for managing farm activities and to improve biodiversity and to reduce the usage of water. Such new invention should be made to enhance and develop the farming. This paper analyses and reveals how IoT can lay a strong foundation towards sustainable development in agriculture.
