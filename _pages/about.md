I am a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](http://iisc.ac.in) working with [Dr. Vaibhav Katewa](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/faculty/vaibhav/). I am an electronics engineer from [Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)](https://vit.ac.in/) in Vellore, India. My research journey started with [Dr. Shunmuga Perumal](https://vitdirectory.vit.ac.in/page/faculty/16385#about) at the [Automotive Research Center](https://rf.vit.ac.in/Research/labs/8) at VIT working on perception models for Autonomous Vehicles in challenging environment with poor road infrastructure. I also interned at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in Zurich, where I worked on using Computer Vision to extract PPG data from facial videos under the expert guidance of [Dr. Moe Elgendi](https://www.elgendi.net/) and [Dr. Carlo Menon](https://www.carlomenon.it/). My research interests lie in the **developing perception for autonomous systems**, and I am excited to continue my education and research in this field. 

I have also had the privilege of leading the Avionics and Software departments at [Assailing Falcons](https://www.assailingfalcons.in), a team that achieved 3rd place Worldwide and 1st place in Asia in the SAE Aero Design Competition in 2021-2022. I also founded the [VIT Amateur Radio Club (VARC)](https://vitarc.github.io) under the guidance of [Dr. Harish Kittur](https://research.vit.ac.in/researcher/kittur-harish-mallikarjun).

In my free time, I love building and flying drones, capturing breathtaking footage that you can find [here](https://sakshambhutani.xyz/blog/category/drone/). I'm also a licenced amateur radio operator (Callsign: VU3DTU) and an avid traveler, having visited 7 countries (CH, AT, DE, FR, LI, AE & NP) and almost all the states in India.
