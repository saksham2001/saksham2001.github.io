I am a highly motivated and talented electronics and communication engineering student currently studying at the [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/) in Vellore, India. With a GPA of 9.34 out of 10, I am dedicated to pursuing my passion for autonomous systems and robotics through practical experience and cutting-edge research. Over the years, I have gained invaluable experience through various research and development projects, including work on perception systems for autonomous vehicles. I am particularly proud of my internship and bachelor's thesis at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in Zurich, where I worked on remote PPG extraction from facial videos under the expert guidance of [Dr. Moe Elgendi](https://www.elgendi.net/) and [Dr. Carlo Menon](https://www.carlomenon.it/).

In addition to my academic achievements, I have also had the privilege of leading the Avionics and Software departments at Assailing Falcons, a team that achieved 3rd place Worldwide and 1st place in Asia in the SAE Aero Design Competition in 2021-2022. My research interests lie in the **application of deep learning and robotics to autonomous systems**, and I am excited to continue my education and research in this field. I am confident that my passion and dedication will allow me to make significant contributions to the field of technology.

When I'm not studying or working on my projects, I love building and flying drones, capturing breathtaking footage that you can find [here](https://sakshambhutani.xyz/posts/2021/07/Drone-Footage/). I'm also an avid traveler, having visited 7 countries (CH, AT, DE, FR, LI, AE & NP) and almost all the states in India.
