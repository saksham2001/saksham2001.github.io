I am a highly motivated and talented electronics and communication engineering student at the [Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/), with a GPA of 9.34 out of 10. I have gained practical experience through research and development projects, including work on perception systems for autonomous vehicles and leading the Avionics and Coding department at [Assailing Falcons](http://assailingfalcons.in/), a team that achieved 1st place in the Technical Design Report and Overall 1st place in Asia in the SAE Aero Design Competition. I also gained valuable experience through an internship at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in ZÃ¼rich, where I worked on remote PPG extraction from facial videos. My major research interests are in the **application of Deep Learning and Robotics to Autonomous Systems**. I am excited to continue my education and research in this field and make significant contributions to the field of technology.
