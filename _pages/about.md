I am a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I hold a background in electronics engineering from [Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)](https://vit.ac.in/) in Vellore, India.

My research journey began under the guidance of [Dr. Shunmuga Perumal](https://vitdirectory.vit.ac.in/page/faculty/16385#about) at the [Automotive Research Center](https://rf.vit.ac.in/Research/labs/8) at VIT, where I focused on developing perception models for autonomous vehicles operating in challenging environments with poor road infrastructure. I then interned at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), working on extracting PPG data from facial videos using computer vision, under the mentorship of [Dr. Moe Elgendi](https://ae.linkedin.com/in/elgendi) and [Dr. Carlo Menon](https://www.carlomenon.it/). Following this, I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](http://iisc.ac.in), collaborating with [Dr. Vaibhav Katewa](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/faculty/vaibhav/) on deep learning-based Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques for mapping and navigation. Additionally, I served as a Visiting Researcher at Khalifa University, where I worked again with [Dr. Moe Elgendi](https://ae.linkedin.com/in/elgendi) on developing intelligent biomedical devices.


I have also had the privilege of leading the Avionics and Software departments at [Assailing Falcons](https://www.assailingfalcons.in), a team that achieved 3rd place Worldwide and 1st place in Asia in the SAE Aero Design Competition in 2021-2022. I also founded and chaired the [VIT Amateur Radio Club (VARC)](https://vitarc.github.io).

In my free time, I love building and flying drones, capturing breathtaking footage that you can find [here](https://sakshambhutani.xyz/blog/tag/drone/). I'm also a licenced amateur radio operator (Callsign: VU3DTU) and an avid traveler. Per aspera ad astra ðŸ’«
