Achievements
======
* Awarded limited edition TiuTerra Crystal by Austrian Space Forum (OeWF). TiuTerra Crystals contains rock samples from China to Mexico and from Canada to New Zealand, including samples from the deep ocean floor and from Antarctica. These samples were analysed by Austrian Space Forum planetary geologists in Innsbruck, Austria and then taken to Swarovski, where they were **combined with a Martian meteorite** to form the Tiuterra Crystals.
